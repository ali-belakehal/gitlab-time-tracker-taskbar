## support further development

gtt is an open source project, developed and maintained completely in my free time.

If you enjoy using gtt you can support the project by [contributing](#) to the code base, 
sharing it to your colleagues and co-workers or monetarily by [donating via PayPal](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=TXL5G4BDN8JP6). 
Every type of support is helpful and thank you very much if you consider supporting the project
